  Special thanks to 糖饼2(bywqdq), he selflessly disclosed the source code and schematic diagram.He did the prototyping and put a lot of effort into code optimization.   
  I am responsible for PCB drawing and audio circuit improvements.There are also all kinds of music test work for PCB finished products.      
  Xiao is responsible for PCB soldering and basic debugging.  
  Thanks to anyone else who reverse engineered the MA-3 chip. The joint efforts of many people made the MA-3 amateur project gradually become more interesting.
